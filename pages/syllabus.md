Some of these policies are provisional due to the first 2 weeks of class being
remote. Check this page in week 2 (around January 12th) for updates regarding
week 3 and beyond.

## Announcements

We will announce important events in the course through Piazza. You must have a
Piazza account and be able to receive notifications through Piazza or check it
daily.

You can join our Piazza course here: [https://piazza.com/ucsd/winter2022/cse15l](https://piazza.com/ucsd/winter2022/cse15l)

## Course Components {#components}

There are several components to the course:

- **Lab sessions**
- **Lecture sessions & weekly quizzes**
- **Lab reports/portfolio posts**
- **Skill demonstrations**

### Labs

The course's lab component is the **main part** of the course, which meets for 2
hours on Wednesdays or Thursdays. In each lab you'll switch between working on
your own, working in pairs, and participating in group discussions about your
approach, lessons learned, programming problems, and so on.

The lab sessions and groups will be led by TAs and tutors, who will note your
participation in these discussions for credit.

### Lecture Sessions & Weekly Quizzes

Lecture sessions are on Monday and Wednesday. You can attend any of the three
lecture sessions on each day. In the first two weeks they will be held via Zoom.
In following weeks they will be held in the normally scheduled lecture halls,
and recorded via Zoom. Lecture attendance is optional.

Each week there will be an online, untimed, multiple-tries quiz due on
_Wednesday morning_ (including week 1). The purpose of this quiz is to make sure
everyone has checked in on the concepts we will be using in lab on Wednesday and
Thursday.

The lecture setup is roughly that on Monday we will introduce the topics and any
reading about the quiz material, then Wednesday we will review the quiz
in class and take additional questions.

### Lab Reports/Portfolio Posts

Every _two_ weeks, you will write a lab report on work from the previous two
weeks, due on Fridays. This will take the form of a blog post on a personal site
you will create in the second week of the course. At the end of the quarter this
means you'll have a personal web site with 5 posts detailing what you learned.
Some lab reports can be completed with a partner; individual assignments will
indicate which ones.

For each post, our staff will review it and either give full credit or give
feedback; you must respond to the feedback to receive full credit on your post.
We'll post specific final deadlines for this feedback

### Skill Demonstrations

Twice during the quarter (week 5 and week 9) you you will record a screencast of
yourself demonstrating some of the skills you learned. This takes the place of
in-person midterm exams. We will grade these screencasts and give feedback on if
they correctly demonstrated what we were looking for.

Then, in place of the final exam, you can re-do one or both of these
demonstrations if you missed credit on them to make up the missed credit. The
final exam may not be exacly the same tasks, but will be similar.

## Grading {#grading}

Each component of the course has a minimum achievement level to get an A, B, or
C in the course. You must reach that achievement level in _all_ of the
categories to get an A, B, or C. Pluses and minuses will be given around the
boundaries of these categories at the instructor's discretion.

    - 8 or more lab participation
    - All quizzes complete and correct, no more than 3 late
    - All 5 lab reports complete with full credit/feedback addressed
    - Full score on both skill demonstrations (either initially or with the
    final make-up)
- **B** achievement:
    - 7 or more lab participation
    - 9/10 quizzes complete and correct, no more than 5 late
    - All 5 lab reports submitted, 4 with full credit/feedback addressed
    - Full score on both skill demonstrations (either initially or with the
    final make-up)
- **C** achievement:
