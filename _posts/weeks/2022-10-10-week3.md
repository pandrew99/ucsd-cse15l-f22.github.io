### To Read

- Read these two articles by Julia Evans (one summarized in a comic below):
    - [When debugging, your attitude matters](https://jvns.ca/blog/debugging-attitude-matters/)
    - [How I Got Better at Debugging](https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/22/how-i-got-better-at-debugging/)
- Read this article by John Regehr: [How to Debug](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/199)
    - You don't need to know what all the technical tools are in these readings (systems programming, CSS, divs, etc)
- From the Regehr article, focus on the vocabulary (symptom, bug, etc); from the Evans articles, focus on the vibes
- This article: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zbMVZxsI1zOBPhSsvBi4kB5dPJuxyOJh/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zbMVZxsI1zOBPhSsvBi4kB5dPJuxyOJh/view?usp=sharing)
  (Note that assigning an article doesn't necessarily mean Joe agrees with everything in it...)
