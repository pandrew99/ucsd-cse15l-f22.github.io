## Week 5 Lab Report {#week5-lab-report}

You'll write this report as a Github Pages page, then print that page to PDF and
upload to Gradescope.

### Researching Commands

Consider the commands¬†`less`, `find`, and `grep`. Choose one. Online, find 3
interesting _command-line options_ or alternate ways to use the command you
chose. For example, we saw the `-name` option for `find` in class. For each of
those options, give 3 examples of using it on files and directories from
`./technical`. Show each example as a code block that shows the command and its
output, and write a sentence or two about what it's doing and why it's useful.

That makes **9** total examples, three each for three different command-line
options. Many commands like these have pretty sophisticated behavior possible
‚Äì¬†it can take years to be exposed to and learn all of the possible tricks and
inner workings.

To find information about the commands, a simple Web search like ‚Äúfind
command-line options‚Äù will probably give decent results. There is also a
built-in command on many systems called `man` (short for ‚Äúmanual‚Äù) that displays
information about commands; you can use `man grep`, for example, to see a long
listing of information about how `grep` works.
