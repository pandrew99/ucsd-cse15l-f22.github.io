## Lab Tasks

**As usual, we provide the lab tasks ahead of time, but they might change or
update before lab starts; these aren't guaranteed to be in their final version
until lab starts at 1pm on Wednesday.**

In this lab you'll make a professional website for yourself where you can post
your lab reports for the course. Please contact the instructor
(`jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu`) if for personal privacy or security reasons you do not
want to publish a public web site, even under a pseudonym.

**Note: If you run into problems with this lab, please don't post on piazza right away. There 
are a few moments in this lab where waiting a minute or two will resolve your issue. If your problem
persists *then* go ahead and make a piazza post.** 

### Motivation

Having a professional portfolio website for yourself can be useful in many, many
ways. It's a useful URL to put at the top of your resume/CV where potential
employers can learn more about you.  Lots of great work in CS is published only on
someone's personal page, or is at least most accessible there.  Most CS faculty
have such a page ([just](https://roseyu.com/) [a
few](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/) [examples](http://kvaccaro.com/) [from
new](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~jensenca/OSU_ENGR/index.html) CSE
faculty), for example.

Also, journaling and logging what you've learned is a powerful tool. Writing
down what we've done and how we've done it, for an audience (real or imagined)
other than ourselves, forces us to confront lingering misconceptions and cements
what we learned in our memories. It's also simply useful to refresh your memory
later!

For these reasons, we'll spend this lab creating a personal page, and then
learning to write a blog post about what we learned.
### git, Github, and Github Pages

Github ([https://www.github.com](github.com)) is a web service for storing and
sharing code, along with a huge number of services surrounding that code. It
uses a tool and protocol called `git` [https://git-scm.com/](git) to store and
retrieve that code. Github Pages
[https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) is one of the services
Github provides for publishing personal and project websites from your Github
account.

This lab is a basic introduction to all of these. We will learn to use them in
more detail as the quarter goes on; learning all that git, Github, or Github
Pages has to offer could take months of practice!

### Creating a Website with Github Pages

Below is a link to a video you can reference for help creating a Github pages site.
[CSE 15L Week 0: Github Pages Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZqizez1Dzs&ab_channel=SamWong)

[![Github Pages Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/GZqizez1Dzs&ab_channel=SamWong/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZqizez1Dzs&ab_channel=SamWong)


#### Make a Github Account

Go to [https://www.github.com](https://www.github.com) and create an account:

![](/images/github-signup.png)

(If you already have an account, you choose if you want to use it or create a
new one for this course).

You can choose any username you like for the account; it doesn't have to be
related to your legal or preferred name, though it can be and often is. Some
people choose names related to their name, like me (my Github account is
[jpolitz](https://github.com/jpolitz)). Others choose more abstract or whimsical
names for their accounts, just like usernames on any other service. Feel free to
do whatever feels right to you, and in any event, you can always [change it
later](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/changing-your-github-username).


#### Create a Repository

Once you've created your account, we are going to _create a new repository_ on
Github. A _repository_ is a folder or directory with an associated history of
changes that were made to the files within it. In this sense, a repository on
Github has some similarities to a folder in Google Drive; the differences are
mainly in the level of control we get in managing that history of changes.

![](/images/new-repository.png)

Name the repository `cse15l-lab-reports` (in my screenshot it looks like the
name is taken because I made it before taking the screenshot; it will be green
and OK for you). Leave the other settings as they are, and click "Create
Repository" at the bottom.

![](/images/create-repository.png)

You should see a screen like this (but with your username):

![](/images/new-repository-screen.png)

Click the "Create a new file" link (small, in blue, beneath the "Set up in
Desktop" button). Make a new file called `index.md`, and put some text in it
(whatever you like).

![](/images/hello-world-pages.png)

Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click "Commit new file". You should see
a view of your repository that now lists a file called `index.md`.

You have a public Github repository with some text in it! You can copy the link
from your browser and paste it into the group chat for your lab group; you
should all be able to see one anothers' repository pages.

#### Making a Pages Site

Next, click on "Settings" at the top of your repository, and then choose the
"Pages" option in the sidebar:

![](/images/settings-repo-button.png)

![](/images/github-pages-branch.png)

Choose `main` as the source for Github Pages, and click "Save".

![](/images/github-pages-link.png)

At the top it'll say “GitHub Pages source saved". **Wait a bit and refresh the page.** Eventually
you'll see a message that says “Your site is live at `<url here>`.” 
Click the link that's shown there; at first it will say the page isn't
found. Wait a few minutes, then refresh the page. **It can take 2-5 minutes for
this step, so give it a few refreshes.** Then you should see the text you wrote
show up on a page like this:

![](/images/hello-world-page-load.png)

**Write down in notes** – everyone should be able to screenshot their page
showing the text they wrote in their `index.md`.

**Write down in notes** – Conduct the following experiment:

Note that in addition to seeing your file at, e.g,
[https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/](https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/),
you can also see it with `index.html` added to the end of the URL:
[https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/index.html](https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/index.html)
(Try it!).  Add another file to your repository with any name you choose, but
end it in the extension `.md`. Can you use this idea to see that file?

Write down what you think is happening when you commit a new file.

#### Editing Markdown

The `.md` extension stands for "Markdown," which is a particular text format
used for writing. There are many good documents on the web. A good cheat sheet
and explainer are here:

- [Cheat sheet](https://commonmark.org/help/)
- [What is Markdown?](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

Skim both of those documents, then try to use some of the elements described in
the cheat sheet in your `index.md` file. How do some of the different formatting
options show up when you use them? Are any surprising?

**Write down in notes** – Try all of the formatting in the “Basic Syntax” part
of the markdown cheat sheet above; everyone should screenshot their page that
uses all of these.

You should now have:

- A repository with at least two files (`index.md` and another one you made up)
- In one of those files, a use of each kind of basic Markdown syntax
- A page that shows the rendered version of your Markdown text at a public URL

**Congratulations** – you now know how to make a (simple), public-facing website
with basic formatting! You can share the link to your page with anyone in the
world with an internet connection, and they can see your page.

(Fun fact: [the page you are
reading](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/blob/main/_posts/weeks/2022-01-10-week2.md)
is written in Markdown and uses Github Pages!)

### Editing Offline

So far, we've suggested that you make all your edits in your web browser using
Github's tools for creating new files and editing existing ones. However, this
is a remarkably inefficient workflow, because each edit can take a few minutes
to show up. Much better would be to use an offline tool, like Visual Studio Code
or another editor, that can give better quick feedback as you work.

To edit offline, we need to be able to (a) download the repository to our
computer, (b) edit the files, and (c) upload the changes back to Github. Github
will re-render all of the Markdown into nice web pages for us each time we
re-upload.

#### Cloning with Github Desktop

There are many ways to download the code from your repository and upload
changes. We will use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to do this
today, and see other options in the future. Even if you have some other
preferred way to do this that you've used before, please do follow the tutorial!
You may learn something new and useful.

Download the [Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/) for Github. Install
it, and log in with your Github account. The startup page should look something
like this:

![](/images/github-desktop.png)

Then, you can get the code from your repository in one of several ways:

- On the repository page, there is a `<> Code` button; you can click on that and
choose “Open with Github Desktop”
- From Github Desktop, you can choose “Clone a Repository from the Internet” and
then choose your repository

You'll see a message about cloning, and then see this page:

![](/images/github-after-clone.png)

One thing that I often find a little surprising about this page is that it
doesn't list any files – `index.md` is nowhere to be found here! This is because
Github Desktop (and the underlying tool, `git`) are all about tracking and
recording _changes_; we won't see much in this interface until we make some
edits or new files.

#### Install VSCode

![](/images/vscode-install.png)

If you don't already have it, go ahead and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is a powerful and free source-code editor that we will use throughout this class. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. 

#### Editing (Markdown) in VSCode

A good way to make edits is to use the convenient “Open in Visual Studio
Code” button. This will open a VSCode window in the directory you just cloned.
If you click it, you should see a fresh window like this:

![](/images/vscode-pages-open.png)

Here's where VSCode comes in handy – open one of the files and look in the _top
right corner_ of the window. There should be a few little symbols, one that
looks like two panels with a magnifying glass over the right panel

![](/images/preview-buttons.png)

Click it, and a live-updating preview of the rendered Markdown will appear!

![](/images/live-formatting.png)

How cool! Make a few edits here; add some text, try out the live formatting.
Then make sure to save the file.

#### Pushing Changes Back

Go back to the Github Desktop window. Now you should see something like this:

![](/images/github-desktop-diff.png)

This view is called a **diff**, and it's showing a summary of what changed. In
red, with `-` signs next to them, are lines that I _removed_ from the file. In
green, with `+` signs next to them, are lines that I _added_ to the file. This
is for us to review before we do two further steps:

- **commit** the changes to save them to our local copy of the repository
- **push** the changes to save them to the remote copy of the repository

If you're happy with your updates, click "Commit to `main`". Above that button
there's also a box where you can write a short message for your own bookkeeping
about why you made this change; in this case you might write “trying out
formatting” or similar.

In this case (_unlike_ in the Github interface in your browser) this commit
action _only_ makes changes on your computer's copy of the repository. If you
opened up Github right at this moment (someone in the group should!) you will
see that these changes are not shown on Github yet.

A separate step takes our committed changes and **push**es them to Github to
store them in the remote repository. You'll see a message prompting you to do
this on the right-hand side in Github Desktop:

![](/images/push-message.png)

This message uses the term **origin** to refer to the remote repository. After
clicking this, you can verify that the changes did in fact show up when you view
your repository's code on Github. Shortly, you should also see your web page
update with the newly-written or changed text.

**Write in notes** – brainstorm: what are some reasons why it be useful that the
act of **commit**ing changes and the act of **push**ing them are in separate
steps?


### Setting Up a Web Page

For your lab report (see below) there are a few key features we need to make
sure we practice. Work with your group to figure some of these out.

#### Including Screenshots

One important part of setting up lab reports in this class will be including
_screenshots_ of your work on the page, which means:

1. Taking and saving the screenshot
2. Adding the image to the repository
3. Adding the right Markdown to include the image

Get your first lab report started by making a new file called
`lab-report-1-week-0.md`. Then, find an image on your computer, like a
screenshot from last week's lab, maybe, or a new screenshot you take now. Copy
or move that image file into your repository that you have open in VScode (you
can drag and drop it into the file explorer).

Then, add an image tag (use the Markdown cheat sheet!) to refer to that image in
`lab-report-1-week-0.md`. Commit the changes to that file along with the image,
and push to Github. Verify that you can see the image in the published version
of your site.

**Write down in notes**: Make sure everyone can include a screenshot image on
their Github pages site. You need it for the lab report!

#### Adding Links

One thing that's helpful on pages like yours is to have links between pages. Add
a link to the index page of your site that points to your lab report page. Which
of the following styles works?

- `[Lab Report 1](lab-report-1-week-0.html)`
- `[Lab Report 1](https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-lab-reports-repo>/lab-report-1-week-0.html)`

**Write down in notes**: What do you think the difference is between these two
styles of creating a link?  Do they have any differences in what happens with
them in the Markdown preview?

#### Having Fun – Themes

Feel free to get creative with your page. Github has [free themes you can
use](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-theme-chooser).

You can also read more about
[Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll),
a tool Github Pages uses to turn your markdown files into web pages.

Concretely, during your lab time, make sure to try at least one theme (you can
always disable it later).

In general, if you want, feel free to do as much styling, editing, theming, etc
as you want with your page – it's yours! We'll just have specific requirements
for what you do for lab reports.

If you have extra time, feel free to spend it writing your lab report.

## Week 0 Lab Report

Before Friday, January 14, you'll submit a _lab report_ by writing a blog post
like we just described. The topic will be remote access.

You will write a tutorial for incoming 15L students (and your future self!)
about how to log into a course-specific account on `ieng6`. Your post should
include the steps you took, along with screenshots of what each step looked
like. You're free to use the screenshots you took for lab 1, or new ones.
Complete any steps you didn't complete in your group on your own.

Overall, make sure you have at least 6 screenshots, one for each of the steps
below (though more is useful, remember that this will help out your future
self). For each step include 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you
did.

- Installing VScode
- Remotely Connecting
- Trying Some Commands
- Moving Files with `scp`
- Setting an SSH Key
- Optimizing Remote Running

If you need some help with **adding images in markdown** to your lab report, you can refer to 
[this article](https://medium.com/markdown-monster-blog/getting-images-into-markdown-documents-and-weblog-posts-with-markdown-monster-9ec6f353d8ec)
to help get you started. Note that there is a difference between `![alt text](/path/to/localimage.png)` and 
`![alt text](https://link-to-online-image.com)`.

You should complete the writing **on your own**. Feel free to ask anyone (staff
or other students are fine!) for help if you're struggling to get remote access
set up, understand commands, get your writing to show up on Github Pages, etc.
But do not get help from anyone on authoring the report itself – the writing and
screenshots **must** be your own.

You will upload your submission by giving a link to your web page in the Lab 1
Report – Week 0 assignment on Gradescope.
