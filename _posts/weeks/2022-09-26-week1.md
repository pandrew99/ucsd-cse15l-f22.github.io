## Lab Tasks

As usual, you can read ahead and are encouraged to prepare! Keep in mind that
the lab isn't guaranteed to be final until the day of the lab, and a lot of the
exercises are collaborative, so you can't truly “finish it ahead of time”.

In this lab you'll set your computer up for remote access to the CSE lab
computers (or log into them directly) and practice with commands that work with
the filesystem. You can bring a laptop and work on that, or you can come and use
the computers in the lab directly, whichever you prefer.

### Part 1 – Meet Your Group!

We've organized everyone into groups of 6-8 students for discussion. These
groups will be somewhat stable throughout the quarter, though some small changes
will likely happen. You will have a tutor or TA assigned to your group for help
and discussion.

Your discussion leader will share a Google Doc with your group where you can
fill in notes as you work; this document is only for your group. Your discussion
leader will _not_ take notes for you, you can have someone volunteer to take
notes or come up with a way to share the role.

**Write down in notes** In your groups, share, and note in the running notes
document (discussion leaders, you answer these as well!):

- How you'd like people to refer to you (pronounce your name/nickname, pronouns
like he/her/they, etc)
- Your major
- One of:
    - A UCSD student organization you're a member of or interested in
    - Your favorite place you've found on campus so far
    - A useful campus shortcut or trick you know

### Part 2 – Your CSE15L Account

Look up your course-specific account for CSE15L here:

[https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

For help on resetting your password here is a tutorial.  
[[TUTORIAL] How to Reset your Password](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit)

### Part 3 – Visual Studio Code

**In Your Group for 10 minutes**

Go to the Visual Studio Code website
[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and follow the
instructions to download and install it on your computer. There are versions for
all the major operating systems, like OSX (for Macs) and Windows (for PCs). If
you only have access to a tablet or Chromebook while remote, you won't be able
to install it right now.  If you don't, you should chat your lab leader and let
them know, and for any pair activities this week and next we will make sure to
pair you with someone who does.

If you run into an error installing Visual Studio Code, speak up! You can
screenshare and ask for help, and the tutor or someone in your group might be
able to answer for you!

When it is installed, you should be able to open a window that looks like this
(it might have different colors, or a different menu bar, depending on your
system and settings):

![/images/vscode.png](/images/vscode.png)

**Write down in notes**: Everyone should share a screenshot of VScode open –
help folks figure it out if it won't install. If someone gets stuck, take a
screenshot of the error message or point at which they are stuck so we can help
them figure it out later, and they can decide to keep trying (potentially with
the tutor helping) or move on.

### Part 4 – Remotely Connecting

**In Your Group for 15 minutes**

**Note:** From this point on it gets a bit confusing when switching between your local compute and remote computer. To help with this, we've created a legend that highlights text to clarify whether we are referring to your *local machine*{: .local} or *remote machine.*{: .remote}

**Local text will be highlighted in pink**{: .local}  
**Remote text will be highlighted in red**{: .remote}

Many courses in CSE use course-specific accounts. These are similar to accounts
you might get on other systems at other institutions (or a future job). We'll
see how to use VScode/terminal to connect to a remote computer over the Internet
to do work there.

There is a first step you need if you're on Windows: install a program called
OpenSSH, which is a program that can connect your computer to other computers
that have this kind of account. You should only install the OpenSSH **client**,
not the server:

[Install OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)


Then, in Visual Studio Code, we are going to connect to the remote computer
using VSCode's remote option.  For reference, we're following the steps in
[“Connect to a remote
host”](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_connect-to-a-remote-host)
step.

For the first step, open a terminal in VSCode (Ctrl or Command + \`, or use the
Terminal → New Terminal menu option).  Your command will look like this, but
with the `zz` replaced by the letters in your course-specific account.
{: .local}

```
$ ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

(That's one, five, l (not one); the one and l look very close in some fonts.)

Since this is likely the first time you've connected to this server, you will
probably get a message like this:
{: .local}

```
⤇ ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```

I (Joe) always say yes to these messages when I'm connecting to a new server for
the first time; it's expected to get this message in that case. If you get this
message when you're connecting to a server you connect to _often_, it could mean
someone is trying to listen in on or control the connection. This answer is a
decent description of what's going on: [Ben Voigt's
answer](https://superuser.com/questions/421074/ssh-the-authenticity-of-host-host-cant-be-established/421084#421084)

So type `yes` and press enter, then give your password; the whole interaction
should look something like this once you give your password and are logged in:
{: .local}

```
⤇ ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6-202.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
Password:

Hello cs15lfa22zz, you are currently logged into ieng6-203.ucsd.edu

Now your terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basement, and any
commands you run will run on that computer! 
{: .remote}
We call your computer the _client_
and the computer in the basement the _server_ based on how you are connected.

If, in this process, you run into errors and can't figure out how to proceed,
ask! When you ask, take a screenshot of your problem and add it to your group's
running notes document, then describe what the fix was. If you don't know how to
take a screenshot, ask!

Remember – it is **rare** for a tutorial to work perfectly. We often have to
stop, think, guess, Google search, ask someone, etc. in order to get things to
work the way the tutorial says. I look up the right way to describe the
`(yes/no)` answer on first login all the time, for example. So you are helping
your group _learn about potential issues_ when you do this, and that's a major
learning outcome of the course! If you see someone else have an issue that you
didn't, ask why, and what might be different about what you did, or how your
environment is set up. You will learn by reflecting on this.

**Write down in notes** When you're done, **discuss** what you saw upon login.
Take a screenshot or copy/paste the output. Did you all see the same thing? What
might the differences mean? Note the results of your discussion in the notes
document.

### Part 5 – Run Some Commands  

Try running the commands `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, and `cp` a few times in
different ways, both on **your computer**{: .local}, and on the **remote computer**{: .remote} after
ssh-ing.  Discuss in your group what you see. Can you cause them to produce
error messages? What do they mean? If you're on Windows, what happens when you
use them on Windows?

Here are some specific useful commands to try:

- `cd ~`
- `cd`
- `ls -lat`
- `ls -a`
- `ls <directory>` where `<directory>` is
`/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/cs15lfa22abc`, where the `abc` is one of the other
group members' username
- `cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt ~/`
- `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt`

**Write down in notes**: Copy at least one example from each group member, with
an explanation, into your shared notes doc.

Hint: To log out of the remote server in your terminal, you can use:

- Ctrl-D
- Run the command `exit`

You can also open more terminals in VSCode (there is a little + button at the
top of the terminal window where you can create another).
{: .local}

### Part 6 – Moving Files over SSH with scp

So far we've seen how we can do some work on local and remote computers. One key
step in _working remotely_ is being able to copy files back and forth between
the computers. There are lots of options for how to do this – you might have
done it yourself in the past by sending yourself an email, or storing it in
Google Drive or Dropbox and accessing it from the another computer later.

We'll see now another way to copy a file (or many files!) from your computer to
a remote computer. The command is called `scp`, and we will always run it from
the _client_ (that means from your computer, not logged into `ieng6`). <span>Create a
file on your computer called `WhereAmI.java` and put the following contents into it:</span>{: .local}

```
class WhereAmI {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("os.name"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.name"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.home"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.dir"));
  }
}
```
Compile and run the WhereAmI program using the `javac` and `java` commands below.
{: .local}
```
javac WhereAmI.java
java WhereAmI
```

What do you see? (If you don't
have `java` installed on your computer, skip this step).

<span>Then, in the terminal from the directory where you made this file, run this
command (as usually, using your username):</span>{: .local}

```
scp WhereAmI.java cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/
```

You should be prompted for a password just like when you log in with `ssh`.  If
you get errors, ask your group members for help! You'll all learn.

Then, <span>log into ieng6 with `ssh` again,</span>{: .local} <span>and use `ls`.</span>{: .remote} You should see the file there
in your home directory! <span>Now you can run the program _on the ieng6 computer_ using `javac`
and `java`. Since `java` is installed on the _server_, everyone should be able
to run it no matter the client.</span>{: .remote}

**Write answer in notes**: Try to get a screenshot of everyone successfully
*using `scp` and `ssh`. If someone can't, no worries! Get a screenshot of where
*they got stuck (don't try to resolve an error for more than a few minutes) and
*put that in the notes so we can help with it later.

**Write answer in notes**: What's different about the output when you run this
on the client vs. the server? What does this mean for what `getProperty` does?

What we see here is one solution for running code remotely – <span>we can copy files
to a remote server with `scp`,</span>{: .local} then <span>log in and run them there.</span>{: .remote}

Before you go on, do the following:

- Have someone on your team start a timer
- Make a change to WhereAmI.java and save the file
- Copy the file to the remote server
- Log into the remote server and run the file
- Stop the timer

**Write answer in notes**: How long did it take you? (Not everyone has to do
this, but someone should.) Assume you'd have to do this process 100 times over
the course of a PA. How long would you spend copying and running the file?

### Part 7 – SSH Keys

So far, we've seen how to log in, run commands, and copy files to a remote
server with `ssh` and `scp`. Every time we log in or run `scp`, we have to type
(or copy-paste) our password. This is frustrating, time consuming, and
interrupts whatever task we were trying to do. Naturally, we should look into if
there are ways to avoid this repetitive, frustrating task with a configuration
or program.

In this case, there is a great solution – `ssh` keys. The idea behind ssh keys
is that a program, called `ssh-keygen`, creates a pair of files called the
_public key_ and _private key_. <span>You copy the public key to a particular location
on the server,</span>{: .remote} and the <span>private key in a particular location on the client.</span>{: .local} Then,
the `ssh` command can use the pair of files in place of your password. This is a
common setup step in lots of work environments that involve code on a server.

Here's what you should run to set this up:
{: .local}

```
# on client (your computer)
$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa): /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:jZaZH6fI8E2I1D35hnvGeBePQ4ELOf2Ge+G0XknoXp0 joe@Joes-Mac-mini.local
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|                 |
|       . . + .   |
|      . . B o .  |
|     . . B * +.. |
|      o S = *.B. |
|       = = O.*.*+|
|        + * *.BE+|
|           +.+.o |
|             ..  |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

**Note:** When given the prompt `Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa):` press `enter` again to specify the *default path* and take note of it. In this case, the default path is `/Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa`.
{: .local}

If you're on Windows, follow the extra `ssh-add` steps here: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement#user-key-generation)

This created two new files on your system; the private key (in a file `id_rsa`)
and the public key (in a file `id_rsa.pub`), stored in the `.ssh` directory on
your computer.
{: .local}

Now we need to copy the _public_ (not the private) key to the `.ssh` directory
of your user account on the server.
{: .remote}

```
$ ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
<Enter Password>
# now on server
$ mkdir .ssh
$ <logout>
# back on client
$ scp /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cs15lfa22@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# You use your username and the path you saw in the command above
```

Once you do this, you should be able to `ssh` or `scp` from this client to the
server without entering your password.

**Write down in notes**: Try to get everyone to the point where they can do
this, and take a screenshot of logging in without a password. If you can't,
share a screenshot and description of where you got stuck!

**Write down in notes**: Repeat the timing experiment of editing and running
`WhereAmI.java` now that you don't have to use a password. How much time is saved
per run?

### Part 8 – Making Remote Running Even More Pleasant

Use what you've learned to come up with the most pleasant process you can for
<span>making a _local_ edit to `WhereAmI.java`, then copying it to the remote server</span>{: .local} <span>and
running it.</span>{: .remote}

Some hints:

- You can write a command in quotes at the end of an `ssh` command to directly
run it on the remote server, then exit. For example, this command will log in
and list the home directory on the remote server:
{: .local}
  ```
  $ ssh cs15lfa22@ieng6.ucsd.edu "ls"
  ```
- You can use semicolons to run multiple commands on the same line in most
terminals. For example, try:
{: .local}
  ```
  $ cp WhereAmI.java OtherMain.java; javac OtherMain.java; java WhereAmI
  ```
- You can use the up-arrow on your keyboard to recall the last command that was
run

**Write down in notes** First try using just what we learned in this lab, and
document the best process you came up with. Try to get the total time for a run
after editing and saving to under 10 total keystrokes/mouse clicks, including
all typing. A "keystroke" is pressing one key on your keyboard. For example,
pressing the up arrow counts as one keystroke, and typing "java" counts as 4.

If you have more time, brainstorm other ideas or search for other ways you might
easily run remote code.

### Part 9 – Wrapup

Discuss with your team – do you have any open questions about things you saw
that you don't understand? Write them down in your notes document or ask your
tutor. Even if they don't know, writing them down means we can come back to them
later!

If you _didn't_ get everything to work, that's OK! Keep trying and make sure
your tutor knows if you're totally stuck getting something set up; we'll be
posting some office hours soon where you can come to get unstuck as well.

## Week 1 Lab Report {#week1-lab-report}

Friday, September 30, you'll submit a _lab report_ by writing a blog post like
we just described. The topic will be remote access.

You will write a tutorial for incoming 15L students (and your future self!)
about how to log into a course-specific account on `ieng6`. Your post should
include the steps you took, along with screenshots of what each step looked
like. You're free to use the screenshots you took for lab 1, or new ones.
Complete any steps you didn't complete in your group on your own.

Overall, make sure you have at least 6 screenshots, one for each of the steps
below (though more is useful, remember that this will help out your future
self). For each step include 2-3 sentences or bullet points describing what you
did. If for some reason you didn't do the step exactly, describe why not (maybe
your computer already had something on it, maybe the department computers worked
differently, etc).

- Installing VScode
- Remotely Connecting
- Trying Some Commands
- Moving Files with `scp`
- Setting an SSH Key
- Optimizing Remote Running

You should complete the writing **on your own**. Feel free to ask anyone (staff
or other students are fine!) for help if you're struggling to get remote access
set up, understand commands, get your writing to show up on Github Pages, etc.
But do not get help from anyone on authoring the report itself – the writing and
screenshots **must** be your own.

You will upload your submission by publishing the page on Github Pages, then
printing the page to PDF and uploading to the Lab Report 1 assignment on
Gradescope.
