## Lab Tasks

As usual, you can read ahead and are encouraged to prepare! Keep in mind that
the lab isn't guaranteed to be final until the day of the lab, and a lot of the
exercises are collaborative, so you can't truly “finish it ahead of time”.

Today we'll use some of what we learned about URLS to create a **web server**.

### The `URLHandler` Interface

There's a lot that web servers can do. We will start with a small fragment of
their behavior that is enough to do interesting work. For now we'll focus on
programs that take a URL as input and respond with the text of a web page. We'll
call the part of the program that does this processing a `URLHandler`:

```
interface URLHandler {
  String processRequest(URI uri);
}
```

We'll also use a class that takes a `URLHandler` and starts up the server that
listens for incoming connections.

```
class Server {
  static void start(int port, URLHandler handler) { ... }
}
```

(Note that it says `URI`, not `URL`. There isn't a meaningful difference between
these concepts for our purposes, and all the URIs we work with are also URLs.
Java has [good documentation on
URI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/URI.html). We'll discuss
what a `port` is below.).

We've provided an implementation of a web server that works with this interface here:

[https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/wavelet](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/wavelet)

Everyone in your group should make a **fork** of this repository.

The fork button is on the upper right:

![](/images/fork-button.png)

This makes a copy of the repository on in your Github account. Then, clone the
repository that you forked (not the original!) using Github Desktop, and open it
in Visual Studio Code.

There are two files in this repository:

- `Server.java` – we wrote this and you can treat it as a “black box”, without
understanding its details for today. Of course, you're welcome to read it and
ask questions about it, but we might defer your questions to Piazza, office
hours, or later to focus on the work specific to this lab.
- `NumberServer.java` – this is a program with a `main` method that creates a
`URLHandler` that manages a single number, and uses `Server.java` to start a web
server using that handler.

**Write down in notes**: Read through the code in `NumberServer.java`. What do
you think each line does? What questions do you have? Discuss these with other
groups. It's OK to have open questions at this point! Many will be resolved by
the next few sections.

### Building and Running the Server

You can build and run the server on your local computer using these two
commands, from the working directory of the clone of the repository. It should
look like this when it works:

```
⤇ javac Server.java NumberServer.java 
⤇ java NumberServer 4000
Server Started! Visit http://localhost:4000
```

Then, in a browser on your computer, open
[http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). You should see something that
looks like this:

![localhost_4000](/images/localhost_4000.png)

There are a few definitions worth discussing here:

- **Ports**: The `4000` above identifies a specific _port_ that the web server
runs on. This is an extra part of a URL that's often used in development; `4000`
isn't special and you could pick others – you're welcome to try a few in the
thousands; it won't break anything.  Sites on the public web actually use a port
as well, either
[`80`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol_) or
[`443`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS), but your browser hides it from you
because it's the default. You're welcome to read about these details, but they
aren't necessary to learn the relevant stuff in this lab.

- **Localhost**: The `localhost` domain refers to _the computer you're on_. So
rather than going out over the internet to send the URL to a particular domain
somewhere else, this page is being handled by the running Java program on your
computer, which we say is “listening” on localhost at port 4000. That work is
what's done in `Server.java` and by Java's `HTTPServer` library.

It's also worth pointing out that the terminal will just sit there without
letting you type more commands while the server is running: it is in an infinite
loop waiting for the next URL request to come in! You can stop the server by
pressing Ctrl-c (this works for any terminal command that's in an infinite
loop).

Try out URLs with paths and queries on the running server as described in
`NumberServer.java`. Based on the code, what paths and query combinations do you
think will have interesting effects? Try them out!

**Write down in notes** – show a screenshot of trying each of the paths that
provide a response based on your reading of `NumberServer.java`. There should be
4: the root path, one for incrementing, one for adding by a specific count, and
one that shows an error.

### Run the Server on a Remote Computer

Next, copy the program to your account on `ieng6` and run it, using strategies
from last week's lab. Feel free to ask your lab tutor for help doing this, and
there might even be strategies that you can find as a group that make it easier
to get the code onto the server! However you do it, make note of how you copied,
built, and ran the code.

Note that there are only 3 ieng6 computers, which presents a problem – each one
only has one port `4000`. If multiple people try to use the same port at the
same time on the same computer, there will be an error:

```
[cs15lfa22@ieng6-202]:wavelet:123$ java NumberServer 4000
Exception in thread "main" java.net.BindException: Address already in use
        at sun.nio.ch.Net.bind0(Native Method)
        at sun.nio.ch.Net.bind(Net.java:461)
        at sun.nio.ch.Net.bind(Net.java:453)
```
{: .remote}

So you can't *all* use port `4000`. If you want something unique for this lab
you can use `5000` + the number of the machine you're sitting in front of if in
room B260, and `6000` + that number if in room B270. Or experiment!

The cool thing about running it on these computers is you can access it from
other computers! After starting the server, you can load your web page from
other places! For example, if you're on `ieng6-201.ucsd.edu` running on port
1234, you can open `http://ieng6-201.ucsd.edu:1234` from another computer in the
lab or your laptop to see the output of the running server. Neat – you've
deployed a web server!

**Write down in notes** Take some screenshots of loading your web server running
on `ieng6`, and the commands you used to copy it over and run it. Did people
have different strategies?

**Write down in notes** Brainstorm a little bit. Now that you have the ability
to make a web server, what are some ideas for other applications you could
create? Think about things you could plausibly build with your knowledge of Java
plus this server interface.  What else might you need to go further?

### Make the Simplest “Search Engine”

Make a new file called `SearchEngine.java`. In it, implement a web server (like
`NumberServer.java`) that tracks a list of strings. It should support a path for
_adding_ a new string to the list, and a path for _querying_ the list of strings
and returning a list of all strings that have a given substring.

Examples of paths/queries:

```
/add?s=anewstringtoadd

/add?s=pineapple

/add?s=apple

/search?s=app
(would return pineapple and apple)
```

When you've done this (and even if you don't finish), push a copy of your new
server to your Github repository; we will use it and improve on it in future
labs.

Before you leave the lab, head to the assignment “Lab2 Participation” on Gradescope and complete it. It only has one question and is not going to take more than a minute. This assignment will be used to award you participation credit for this lab. Please note that you will be receiving full credit for participation only if you have attended the lab in-person and actively engaged in discussions with your group.
