## Lab Tasks

In this week's lab you will write an automatic ‚Äúgrader‚Äù for some of the
methods we worked on in week 3.

In particular, you'll write a script and a test file that gives a score to the
functionality of a student-submitted `ListExamples` file and class (see
[ListExamples.java](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/lab3/blob/main/ListExamples.java)).
The specific format is that you'll write a `bash` script that takes the URL of
a Github repository and prints out a grade:

```
$ bash grade.sh https://github.com/some-username/some-repo-name
... messages about points ...
```

This will work with a test file that _you_ write in order to grade students'
work. You can use this repository to get started with your grader
implementation; you should **make a fork**:

[https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-examples-grader](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-examples-grader)

### ‚ÄúStudent‚Äù Submissions

Assume the assignment spec was to submit:

- A repository with a file called `ListExamples.java`
- In that file, a class called `ListExamples`
- In that class, two methods:
  - `static List<String> filter(List<String> s, StringChecker sc)`
  - `static List<String> merge(List<String> list1, List<String> list2)`
- These methods should have the implementations suggested in [lab 3](/week/week3/)

You should use the following repositories to test your grader:

- [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-lab3](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-lab3),
  which has the same code as the starter from lab 3
- [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected),
  which has the methods corrected (I would expect this to get full or
  near-to-full credit)
- [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-compile-error](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-compile-error),
  which has a syntax error of a missing semicolon. Note that your job is _not_
  to fix this, but to decide what to do in your grader with such a submission!
- [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-signature](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-signature),
  which has the types for the arguments of `filter` in the wrong order, so it
  doesn't match the expected behavior.
- [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-filename](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-filename),
  which has a great implementation saved in a file with the wrong name.
- [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-nested](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-nested),
  which has a great implementation saved in a nested directory called `pa1`.
- **Challenge**
  [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-examples-subtle](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-examples-subtle),
  which has more subtle bugs (hints: see
  [`assertSame`](https://javadoc.io/doc/junit/junit/latest/index.html), which
  compares with `==` rather than `.equals()`, and think hard about duplicates
  for `merge`)

### Your Grading Script

For each of the submissions above, your grader should produce either:

- A grade message that says something about a score (maybe pass/fail, or maybe
  a proportion of tests passed ‚Äì¬†your choice) if the tests run.
- A useful feedback message that says what went wrong if for any reason the
  tests couldn't be run (compile error, wrong file submitted, etc.)

A general workflow for your script could be:

1. Clone the repository of the student submission to a well-known directory
name (provided in starter code)
2. Check that the student code has the correct file submitted. If they didn't,
detect and give helpful feedback about it.
  - Useful tools here are `if` and `-e`/`-f`. You can use the `exit` command to
    quit a bash script early.
3. Somehow get the student code and your test `.java` file into the same
directory
  - Useful tools here might be `cp` and maybe `mkdir`
4. Compile your tests and the student's code from the appropriate directory
with the appropriate classpath commands. If the compilation fails, detect and
give helpful feedback about it.
  - Aside from the necessary `javac`, useful tools here are output redirection
    and error codes (`$?`) along with `if`
  - This might be a time where you need to turn _off_ `set -e`. Why?
5. Run the tests and report the grade based on the JUnit output.
  - Again output redirection will be useful, and also tools like `grep` could
    be helpful here

Do the work in pairs!  As a pair, you should produce **one** implementation
‚Äì¬†push it to one member's fork of the starter Github repository and include
the link to that repository in your notes.

**Write down in notes** screenshots of what your grader does on each of the
sample student cases above.

### Running it Through a Server

We've also provided our `Server.java` and a server we wrote for you called
`GradeServer.java` in the starter repository.

You can compile them and use

```
java GradeServer 4000
```

to run the server.

Look at the code to understand the expected path and parameters in
`GradeServer.java`. Loading a URL at the `/grade` path with one of the repos
above as the query parameter. What happens?

That's quite a bit of the way towards an autograder like Gradescope!

**Write down in notes**: Show a screenshot of the server running your
autograder in a browser.

**Discuss and write down**: What other features are needed to make this work
more like Gradescope's autograder? (Think about running for different students,
storing grades, presenting results, etc)

Congratulations! You've done one kind of the work that your TAs do when setting
up classes üôÇ

## Week 7 Lab Report

This week's lab report focuses on material from the week 6 lab; you can start
it before the week 7 lab.

### Part 1

Pick one of the tasks from the week 6 lab that your group completed in Vim in
the second set of tasks. The full descriptions are in the [week 6
descriptions](/week/week6); as a brief reminder:

- Changing the name of the `start` parameter and its uses to `base`
- Adding a new line to `print` before `File[] paths = f.listfiles()`
- Changing the `main` method to take a command-line argument

Pick **one** of these, and give the _shortest_ sequence of `vim` commands that
your group came up with to accomplish the task. (If you don't have access to
your group's notes or otherwise don't know for some reason, come up with your
own that is less than 30 total keys pressed).

Write out the sequence of keys to press using code formatting (with backticks
\`). Use `<>` to indicate special keys (`<Backspace>` or `<Enter>` or `<Esc>`)
and just the keys themselves for other keys pressed. Then, for each command
where you move the cursor or change the text, take a screenshot and describe
which commands/keypresses got to that step.

Write out _every key pressed_, including if you use the arrows or `h` `j` `k`
`l` to move around. These count towards the 30 keys pressed!

For example, if I were opening a program and changing the first occurrence of
the word ‚Äúapple‚Äù to ‚Äúbanana‚Äù in a file containing `blueberry apple
sauce`, I might write:

`/apple<Enter>cebanana<Esc>:w<Enter>`

- A description/screenshot of typing `/apple<Enter>` and the cursor jumping to
  the start of `apple`
- A description/screenshot of typing `ce`, switching into input mode and
  deleting the word `apple`
- A description/screenshot of typing `banana<Esc>`, replacing the text and
  returning to insert mode
- A description/screenshot of typing `:w<Enter`, saving the changes

### Part 2

When you go on to CSE30/courses beyond, internships that involve configuring
servers, or any other tasks where you work on remote machines, you'll have to
make decisions about how you manage your workflow. These aren't the only two
options (indeed, here we don't even discuss using `git`, for example). However,
it's useful to compare two potential strategies.

Consider performing the edit task you chose and re-running the program _when
you have to run it remotely_. Time yourself twice:

- Once, start in Visual Studio Code and make the edit there, then
  `scp` the file to the remote server and run it there to confirm it
  works (you can just run `bash test.sh` on the remote to test it out).
  Consider having the appropriate `scp` command in your command history or
  easily copy-pasteable!
- Second, start already logged into a `ssh` session. Then, make the edit
  for the task you chose in Vim, then exit Vim and run `bash test.sh`.

Report how long it took you to make the edit in seconds in both styles, and any
difficulties or details that came up in doing so.

Then, answer this question with a few sentences:

- Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a
  program that you were running remotely, and why?
- What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or
  another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)

### Submission

Post both parts as a page on your Github Pages site, and submit the
printed-to-PDF version of the `.html` page to the ‚ÄúLab Report 4 ‚Äì¬†
Vim‚Äù Gradescope assignment.
