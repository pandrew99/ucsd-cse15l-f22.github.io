## Lab Tasks

In this week's lab you'll practice _remote collaboration_ via _code review_.
In-person attendance is not required. You'll get participation credit by
completing a more detailed Gradescope assignment where you give feedback on one
of your classmates' repositories from lab 7.

Some staff will be available during lab times to help if you have questions.
You can treat this help time as open office hours and ask about anything,
whether about this lab, completing the next lab report, practicing a skill demo
redo, or other past work.

A common task in programming is _code review_, where you review someone's
solution to a problem and try to identify improvements. Code review has another
role in team-based software projects, which is to _share knowledge_ about code
between members of the team who may be working semi-independently. This makes
code review a great task for us in class, as both you and the student whose
code you're reviewing have the opportunity to learn.

The prompts for the code review are in [this Gradescope
assignment](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/438340/assignments/2443363).
Follow those prompts to complete the lab. Briefly, you will:

- Find which repository you are assigned at [this Piazza post](https://piazza.com/class/l7pbb88wlepvh/post/493)
- Download, build, and try running it
- Describe something you learned from reading the code
- Describe an improvement to make to the code
- Give other open-ended feedback about the code

## Lab Report 5

First, make sure your grading script from Lab 7 can successfully give feedback
on all of the sample student submissions. You might make some judgment calls
about which ones get “credit” or not! But there should be something
meaningfully reported for all of them. You should confirm that this works
through the browser interface as well as the command line.

To demonstrate this, include in your lab report:

- Your `grade.sh` in a code block
- Screenshots of **three** different student submissions and their reported
  grade as loaded in the browser (URL like `https://localhost:4000/grade?repo=https://github.com...`)

Then, choose _one_ of the examples you showed in screenshot, and describe a
_trace_ of what your `grade.sh` does on that example.

To _trace_ the script, describe:

- For each line with a command, what its _standard output_ and _standard error_
  are for this run, and whether its _return code_ was zero or nonzero
- For each line with an `if` statement, whether the condition was true or
  false, and why
- Indicate each line that _does not_ run (maybe because it is in an `if` branch
  that doesn't evaluate, or after an early exit)

Submit your report to the Lab Report 5 (week 9) on Gradescope, due Monday,
November 28 at 12pm (noon).
