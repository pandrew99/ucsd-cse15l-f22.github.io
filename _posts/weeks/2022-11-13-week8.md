## Lab Tasks

In this week's lab you'll practice _remote collaboration_ via _code review_.
In-person attendance is not required. You'll get participation credit by
completing a more detailed Gradescope assignment where you give feedback on one
of your classmates' repositories from lab 7.

Some staff will be available during lab times to help if you have questions.
You can treat this help time as open office hours and ask about anything,
whether about this lab, completing the next lab report, practicing a skill demo
redo, or other past work.

A common task in programming is _code review_, where you review someone's
solution to a problem and try to identify improvements. Code review has another
role in team-based software projects, which is to _share knowledge_ about code
between members of the team who may be working semi-independently. This makes
code review a great task for us in class, as both you and the student whose
code you're reviewing have the opportunity to learn.

The prompts for the code review are in [this Gradescope
assignment](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/438340/assignments/2443363).
Follow those prompts to complete the lab. Briefly, you will:

- Find which repository you are assigned at [this Piazza post – will have this
  list soon!](https://piazza.com/class/l7pbb88wlepvh/post/493)
- Download, build, and try running it
- Describe something you learned from reading the code
- Describe an improvement to make to the code
- Give other open-ended feedback about the code
