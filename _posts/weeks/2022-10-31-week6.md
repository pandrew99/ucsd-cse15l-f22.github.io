## Lab Tasks

### Sharing What You Learned

Share the link to the Github Pages site for your Lab Report 3 in your group's
lab doc, and write which command you researched for the lab report along with
it.

Pair up with someone else in your lab group who chose a different command to
research than you for Lab Report 3. Try one another's examples, and talk about
what you learned from trying them out. Are there any useful ways to combine the
two commands? Do they answer any new questions you hadn't thought of before?

Share what you think the coolest example is from each of your lab reports with
the whole group. **Write these down in notes**

### Doing it All From the Command Line

#### Editing from the command line: `vim`

Log into ieng6. Run the command `vimtutor`. Set a timer for 15 minutes.

Complete the first two lessons (go past lesson 2 if you can in 15 minutes).
Really do the exercises!

After the 15 minutes are up, clone the repository from the first skill
demonstration. If you already have it cloned, you can clone a new copy by giving
the name of a new directory to make after the git URL, like this:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/skill-demo1 week6-skill-demo1
```

This will clone it and put it in the `week6-skill-demo1` directory.

Fix the test using what you learned about `vim` in the tutorial (as a reminder,
you're changing the `10` to `1391` in the expected value of the test). Re-run
the tests to make sure it works.

Cool! You just did an entire short programming task from the terminal. Decades
ago, this was the only option. Personally, I'm pretty glad VSCode and Eclipse
and other tools exist these days, **but** it turns out it's still useful to know
how to edit at the command line.

As a group, discuss and **write in notes**:

- What were two things you thought were annoying about using Vim? Be specific.
- What were two things you thought were cool about using Vim? Be specific.

For the rest of the lab (and whenever it strikes your fancy), try using `vim` if
you need to edit files!

#### Committing from the command line: `git add/git commit`

You can prepare commits from the command line, too. Run the following commands:

```
$ git add TestDocSearch.java
$ git commit
```

The first command is usually done for you by Github Desktop, but requires a
manual step at the command line. `git` gives fine-grained control over which
changes get included in a commit.

The second command drops you into... a `vim` session! The `git` command actually
runs the command so you can edit the commit message; it will look like this:

```
 
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting 
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit. 
# 
# Committer: Joseph Gibbs Politz <cs15lfa22@ieng6-203.ucsd.edu> 
# 
# On branch main 
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'. 
# 
# Changes to be committed: 
#       modified:   TestDocSearch.java 
# 
# Untracked files: 
#       DocSearchServer.class 
#       FileHelpers.class 
#       Handler.class 
#       Server.class 
#       ServerHttpHandler.class 
#       TestDocSearch.class 
#       URLHandler.class 
#
```

Use `vim` commands to write a message, save it, and quit. Then use `git log`,
and you should see your commit in the log:

```
$ git log
commit d61dc457045d478618bc10ea8b3f1afe72ed069c (HEAD -> main)
Author: Joseph Gibbs Politz <cs15lfa22@ieng6-203.ucsd.edu>
Date:   Mon Oct 31 00:08:25 2022 -0700

    Fix tests
```

#### Practice

**Next**, use `vim` to make the _other_ change from the skill
demonstration—making the server search by pathname rather than by file
contents—and similarly make a commit for it.

Show the resulting `git log` in the notes doc.

Also write down in notes:

- What errors or surprising behavior did you run into while doing this?
- What's a situation where you can imagine needing or wanting to use these
command-line tools instead of more familiar ones like VScode?
